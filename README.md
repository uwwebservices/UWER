# Event Registration [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uwwebservices/idcard-webapp-poc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uwwebservices/idcard-webapp-poc)

EWS Event Registration (EWSER) is a Node.js application that utilizes Person Web Service (PWS), ID Card Web Service (IDCardWS), and Groups Web Service (GWS) to register users for an event via Husky Card swipes or RFID taps. EWSER takes advantage of the GWS ability store members in subgroups, allowing someone to setup one base group and have many subgroups for registering members to. EWSER can be setup to register to the same group from multiple locations and at the end export to a CSV file for usage in other systems.






Project to demonstrate an event registration application.  The idea being, with this application and some minimal setup you can deploy to a device (desktop/laptop/Raspberry Pi/etc.) capable of running node.js and take attendance via card swipes (magstripe/rfid). Submitting a huskycard rfid/magstrip/netid looks up users regid and passes to PWS to get more user details, and adds users to a UW Group leaf.  After collecting users a list of registered users in plain/verbose format can be returned as well as the UW group will have the member list or download a list as a CSV.  Verbose output from the API includes various user information as well as gia base64 encoded image from their husky card.

This project is also intended to be a reference on how to use various APIs, see src/backend/models for the various APIs as examples.

## Requirements
- UWCA x509 certificate, authorized for IDCard/PWS/Groups
- node.js and npm/yarn
- [optional] docker/docker-compose
- [optional] card magstrip/rfid reader

## Current Features
- PWS/GroupsWS/IDCard APIs
- Register users to a UWGroup or memory store
- Full RESTful API
- Dev environment hot reloading for server and frontend
- Dockerhub integration
- Frontend to show usage possibilities

## Docker-Compose Install
```
version: '3'
services:
  idcard:
    image: uwwebservices/idcard-webapp-poc
    volumes:
      - /path/to/storage:/www/dist/config
    ports:
      - "1111:1111"
```

## Dev Setup
1. Copy config.json.example to config.json and update as necessary
2. Add cert.pfx to config directory or wherever config.json references
3. npm install && npm run dev

## Commands

1. npm run dev -> start development server
2. npm run build -> build project
3. npm start -> build project and start in production mode
4. npm test -> run eslint on src

## API Endpoints

### Registration
GET /api/register[?verbose=[0-2]] - List members in configured group
PUT /api/register/:identifier - Add cardNum (rfid/magstrip/netid) to configured group  
DELETE /api/register/:netid - Remove member from group by netid

### GroupsWS
GET /api/groups/:groupName - List users in groupName  
GET /api/groups/:groupName/check - Check if group exists
PUT /api/groups/:groupName/:netid - Add netid to groupName  
DELETE /api/groups/:groupName/:netid - Remove netid from groupname  
DELETE /api/groups/:groupName - Remove the group from GroupsWS  

### PWS
GET /api/pws/:Id - Returns the full PWS listing for the regId or netId

### IDCardWS
GET /api/idcard/:cardNum - Returns RegID for given cardNum (rfid/magstrip)  
GET /api/idcard/photo/:regId - Returns a base64 image for a regId

## Technical Details
- nodemon for monitoring server file changes
- webpack-hot-middleware to monitor frontend file changes
- support for es6 and React transpiling
- cross-env for environment variables
- scripts/styles bundled in-memory (dev) and exported (prod)
- promises everywhere
- Dockerhub auto-generation (https://hub.docker.com/r/uwwebservices/idcard-webapp-poc/)
